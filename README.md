# jsPasswordObfuscator
This is a simple tool which makes it less unsafe to reuse passwords with only a small change.
Of course this does not make it a good idea to re-use passwords on different websites! However, for the people as lazy as me who only append the website name to differentiate between the passwords this helps to make them a bit more secure.

To use it just call the function with your password as a string as the only argument.
